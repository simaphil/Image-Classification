# Weather Classification Using Neural Networks

## Overview

In this project I use python to create neural networks that classify weather conditions in images. The model is trained to recognize and categorize weather conditions such as cloudy, rain, (sun)shine, sunrise based on the visual features of the images. 

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies weather conditions from input images.
- **Neural Network Model**: Utilizes advanced neural network architectures for accurate weather prediction.
- **Preprocessing**: Includes image preprocessing steps to prepare data for training and inference, using differnet types of optimizations and comparing the results.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy
- **Data**: Custom dataset of weather images
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Optimzations**: RMSprop, Adam, SGD, data augmentation
